# ProTasker

ProTasker is an application for project management and various tasks. 
The application uses Firebase Firestore as a database to store all information about projects and users. User authentication also takes place through Firebase Authentication.

--- USER INFORMATION --- 

Project management can sometimes be a challenge, but ProTasker is here to help. In this app, users can create lists of tasks on a project. 

Tasks have many functions for labelling. The user can set a deadline for the task, indicate the status of the task with a colour. It is also possible to assign a task to a specific performer, but the performer must be registered in the ProTasker system.

For the convenience of users, a separate section "My cards" has been created. Here they can see all their cards, i.e. the tasks they need to complete in all their projects.
